## Introduction: What is `codename goose`?
`codename goose` (or simply "Goose") is an advanced, open-source AI agent designed to function as an on-machine engineering assistant. Its primary purpose is to automate a wide range of software development tasks, moving beyond simple code suggestions to handle complex workflows from inception to completion. Goose aims to significantly enhance developer productivity by taking on intricate engineering challenges.

## Core Capabilities
Goose is built to:
- **Understand and Process Requests**: Interpret developer requests given in natural language.
- **Plan Complex Tasks**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Write and Modify Code**: Generate new code, refactor existing codebases, and fix bugs.
- **Execute Code and Commands**: Run scripts, shell commands, and interact with build systems.
- **Interact with Tools and APIs**: Utilize a wide array of tools, including file system operations, version control, web searching, and external service APIs through its extension system.
- **Debug Issues**: Analyze failures and attempt to self-correct or suggest solutions.
- **Orchestrate Workflows**: Manage sequences of operations to achieve a larger goal.
- **Operate Autonomously**: Perform tasks with minimal human intervention once a goal is set, while also allowing for user oversight and guidance.

## How `codename goose` Works: A High-Level View

### User Interaction
Developers interact with Goose through two primary interfaces:
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Offers a text-based way to issue commands, manage sessions, and receive updates.
- **Desktop Application**: Provides a graphical user interface for a more visual interaction, typically embedding a server component (`goosed`) that runs the core agent logic.

### LLM-Powered Reasoning
At its heart, Goose leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for its reasoning capabilities. When a task is provided:
1. Goose formulates prompts (including system instructions, conversation history, and available tools) to send to an LLM.
2. The LLM processes this information to understand the task, devise a plan, decide which tools to use, or generate code/text.

### Task Decomposition and Planning
For complex tasks, Goose (guided by the LLM) often creates a plan, which is a sequence of steps it intends to follow. This plan can be reviewed by the user and is updated as the agent makes progress or encounters issues. This ability to plan and reflect is crucial for tackling multi-step engineering problems.

### Extensible Toolset via Extensions
Goose's power comes from its ability to use "tools." These tools are functions or capabilities that allow it to interact with the developer's environment and external services.
- **Extensions**: The primary way new tools are added to Goose. Extensions can be:
    - **Built-in**: Core functionalities like file operations or shell access.
    - **Custom**: Developers can create their own extensions.
    - **MCP-based**: Tools can be provided by external services/processes communicating via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Tool Usage**: The LLM decides which tool to use and with what arguments. Goose then executes the tool, captures the output (or error), and feeds this information back to the LLM for the next step in its reasoning process.

### Autonomous Operation & User Guidance
- **Autonomous Mode**: Goose can operate autonomously, making decisions and executing tools based on the LLM's reasoning and the plan it has formulated.
- **User Control**: Goose incorporates a permission system where tool usage can be set to `AlwaysAllow`, `NeverAllow`, or `AskBefore`. This allows developers to maintain control, especially over potentially destructive actions. The agent surfaces errors and its plan to the user, allowing for intervention and guidance.

### Multi-Model Strategy
Goose can be configured to use different LLMs for different aspects of its operation to balance cost, speed, and capability. This includes:
- **Lead/Worker Pattern**: Using a powerful model for planning and a faster/cheaper model for execution.
- **Specialized Planner Model**: A dedicated model for the planning phase.

## Key Benefits
- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Automates tedious and complex engineering tasks.
- **Task Automation**: Handles end-to-end workflows, from idea to execution.
- **Extensibility**: Customizable with new tools and integrations via its extension system.
- **Flexibility**: Works with various LLM providers and can be adapted to different development environments.
- **Local Operation**: Runs on the developer's machine, providing better control and context awareness.
